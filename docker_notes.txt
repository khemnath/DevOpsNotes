Basic Information:-
if you want to run any program software you need OS.
In order to run OS you need Hardware.
Inorder to run Hardware we need Ram/CPU.

## Run a docker container in background.
$ docker run -d -i -t --name <Custom_images_name> <Docker_Image>. 
   --> run lauch OS, d means background, i means interactive, t means terminal.
   --> when docker is lauch they have their own IP Address.
   --> Due to security reason when a docker is lauch they are Isolated. Nobody from outside World can connect to their IP.
   --> You may create and Run serveral docker container in a System, each container will have their own IP.
   --> All docker container within system can connect each other and with Host system. However, they cannot be directly connected from outside.
   --> If we want the outside World to connect to our docker. We need to provide an access, this access is call "expose".
       For expose there is not Networking concept called PAT.(Port Address translation). Below is way of doing so from docker command.
       -p  means patting, exposing to outside world.
$ docker run -d -t -i -p 8081:80 -v /local/system/path:/docker/container/path/to/link --name <images_name> Docker_Image
-- This mean lauch an OS from an image. If you want to expose out side world you need to use the option - "-p 8081:80".
-- Now you can connect trough your HOST OS IP:PORT (8081).

       


## Check the history of the image created.
$ docker history <images_name> 

## copy a file from local system to Docker container.
$ docker cp file1 <container_image>:/path/to/copy/to

## Link folder from local system to Docker container.(in linux term it's also call mounting OR also bind)
$ docker run -d -i -t -v /local/system/path:/docker/container/path/to/link --name <images_name> Docker_Image
 --> -v means volume.

## check docker container IP or Network informaton.
$ docker inspect <container_image>
