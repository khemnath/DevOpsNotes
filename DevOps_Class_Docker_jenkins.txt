Basic Information:-
if you want to run any program software you need OS.
In order to run OS you need Hardware.
Inorder to run Hardware we need Ram/CPU.

$ docker run -d -i -t --name <Custom_images_name> <Docker_Image>. 
   --> run lauch OS, d means background, i means interactive, t means terminal.
   --> when docker is lauch they have their own IP Address.
   --> Due to security reason when a docker is lauch they are Isolated. Nobody from outside World can connect to their IP.
   --> You may create and Run serveral docker container in a System, each container will have their own IP.
   --> All docker container within system can connect each other and with Host system. However, they cannot be directly connected from outside.


## Check the history of the image created.
$ docker history <images_name> 

## copy a file from local system to Docker container.
$ docker cp file1 <container_image>:/path/to/copy/to

## Link folder from local system to Docker container.(in linux term it's also call mounting OR also bind)
$ docker run -d -i -t -v /local/system/path:/docker/container/path/to/link --name <images_name> Docker_Image
 --> -v means volume.
